assign LEDR[0] = valid;
assign LEDR[1] = makeBreak;
assign LEDR[9:2] = outCode;
The outCode is 2 bytes
So basically [9:6] is the higher byte and [5:2] is the lower byte
Keyboard will have different outCode when pressed or released listed in the pdf file
and makeBreak is 0 when released , 1 when presses.
It is pretty tough to judge from the video,so could you probably help to make sure it is using Set2.
